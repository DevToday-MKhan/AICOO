## 📋 Railway Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Railway Project

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose `DevToday-MKhan/AICOO`
5. Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile

### Step 2: Add PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project, click "+ New"
2. Select "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically create `DATABASE_URL` variable

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Add these in Railway dashboard → Variables:

```env
# Shopify Configuration
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
SHOPIFY_SCOPES=read_products,write_products,read_orders,write_orders,read_customers,write_customers,read_inventory,write_inventory
SHOPIFY_APP_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2024-10

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview

# Session
SESSION_SECRET=generate-random-32-char-string-here

# Database (auto-generated by Railway PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (Railway provides this)

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 4: Get Shopify Credentials

1. Go to [partners.shopify.com](https://partners.shopify.com)
2. Click "Apps" → "Create app"
3. Choose "Custom app"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Node version: `node -v` (should be 18.x)
- Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check TypeScript errors: `npm run typecheck`

### Shopify Auth Fails
- Verify SHOPIFY_APP_URL matches Railway domain
- Check redirect URLs in Shopify Partner dashboard
- Ensure SHOPIFY_API_KEY and SECRET are correct

### GPT Not Responding
- Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is valid
- Check Railway logs for OpenAI errors
- Ensure billing is set up on OpenAI account

### Database Errors
- Verify DATABASE_URL is set
- Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- Check Prisma client generation: `npx prisma generate`
